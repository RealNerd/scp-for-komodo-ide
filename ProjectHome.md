This is a bare-bones extension to provide basic SCP services to the Komodo IDE as an extension. The extension uses OS-level scp and a basic project mapping policy to copy the active file to a remote server.

I'm still working on the [Documentation](Documentation.md), so if you happen to come across this extension before I have actual docs, email me. The [TodoList](TodoList.md) contains a short list of items that are not complete, but that would make the extension even better.

I've written a brief blog post about this extension: http://www.thewhyandthehow.com/scp-for-komodo-ide/
